- **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** is an open-source platform for building universal native apps (Android, iOS, web) using JavaScript/TypeScript and React Native. It features file-based routing via Expo Router, fast refresh, native modules for camera/maps/notifications, over-the-air updates (EAS), and streamlined app deployment.

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** is a framework for building mobile UIs with React. It enables component‚Äëbased, cross-platform development with declarative UI, deep native API support, and is tightly integrated with Expo for navigation and native capabilities.

- **[Appwrite](https://jsm.dev/rn25-appwrite)** is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering secure authentication (email/password, OAuth, SMS, magic links), databases, file storage with compression/encryption, real-time messaging, serverless functions, and static site hosting via Appwrite Sites‚Äîall managed through a unified console and microservices architecture.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript providing type annotations, interfaces, enums, generics, and enhanced tooling. It improves error detection, code quality, and scalability‚Äîideal for robust, maintainable projects.

- **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** brings Tailwind CSS to React Native and Expo, allowing you to style mobile components using utility-first classes for fast, consistent, and responsive UI design.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI design via low-level classes. In React Native/Expo, it‚Äôs commonly used with NativeWind to apply Tailwind-style utilities to mobile components.

## <a name="quick-start">ü§∏ Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone [git remote URL]
```

**Installation** 

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_GALLERIES_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_REVIEWS_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_AGENTS_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROPERTIES_COLLECTION_ID=
```
Replace the values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up & creating a new project on [**Appwrite**](https://jsm.dev/rn25-appwrite).

**Start the app**
   
```bash
 npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
